data(heights)
options(digits = 3)    # report 3 significant digits for all answers

#1,First, determine the average height in this dataset. 
#Then create a logical vector ind with the indices for 
#those individuals who are above average height.
#How many individuals in the dataset are above average height?
ind <- heights$height > mean(heights$height)
sum(ind)

#2,How many individuals in the dataset are above average height and are female?
ind2 <- heights$height > mean(heights$height) & heights$sex == "Female"
sum(ind2)

#3,If you use mean() on a logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector, 
#it returns the proportion of observations that are TRUE.
#What proportion of individuals in the dataset are female?
mean(heights$sex == "Female")

#4,a,Determine the minimum height in the heights dataset.
min(heights$height)
#b,Use the match() function to determine the index 
#of the individual with the minimum height.
which.min(heights$height)
match(c(min(heights$height)), heights$height)
#c,Subset the sex column of the dataset by the index 
#in 4b to determine the individualâ€™s sex.
heights$sex[which.min(heights$height)]

#5,Question 5
#This question takes you through three steps to determine
#how many of the integer height values between the minimum 
#and maximum heights are not actual heights of individuals in the heights dataset.
#a,Determine the maximum height.
max(heights$height)
#b,Which integer values are between the maximum and minimum heights? 
#For example, if the minimum height is 10.2 and the maximum height is 20.8, 
#your answer should be x <- 11:20 to capture the integers in between those values.
#(If either the maximum or minimum height are integers, include those values too.)
#Write code to create a vector x that includes the integers 
#between the minimum and maximum heights.
mid <- min(heights$height):max(heights$height)
#c,How many of the integers in x are NOT heights in the dataset?
sum(!mid %in% heights$height)

#Question 6
#Using the heights dataset, create a new column of heights in centimeters named ht_cm. 
#Recall that 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters. Save the resulting dataset as heights2.
heights2 <- mutate(heights, ht_cm = heights$height*2.54)
#a,What is the height in centimeters of the 18th individual (index 18)?
heights2$ht_cm[18]
#b,What is the mean height in centimeters?
mean(heights2$ht_cm)

#7,Create a data frame females by filtering 
#the heights2 data to contain only female individuals.
females = filter(heights2, heights2$sex == "Female")
#a,How many females are in the heights2 dataset?
str(females)
#b,What is the mean height of the females in centimeters?
mean(females$ht_cm)

#8,The olive dataset in dslabs contains composition 
#in percentage of eight fatty acids found in the lipid fraction 
#of 572 Italian olive oils:
library(dslabs)
data(olive)
head(olive)
#Plot the percent palmitic acid versus palmitoleic acid in a scatterplot. 
#What relationship do you see?
plot(olive$palmitic, olive$palmitoleic)
#=>There is a positive linear relationship between palmitic and palmitoleic.

#9,Create a histogram of the percentage of eicosenoic acid in olive.
#Which of the following is true?
hist(olive$eicosenoic)
#=>The most common value of eicosenoic acid is below 0.05%.

#10,Make a boxplot of palmitic acid percentage in olive 
#with separate distributions for each region.
boxplot(olive$palmitic~region,data=olive)
#Which region has the highest median palmitic acid percentage?
#=>Southern Italy
#Which region has the most variable palmitic acid percentage?
#=>Southern Italy
